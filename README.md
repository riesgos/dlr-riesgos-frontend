## Disclaimer
> :warning: This is the prototype of a multi-risk exploration tool and still under development. **IMPORTANT**: the results shown here are not yet consolidated and therefore not suitable for planning or other practical applications. As explained in our [License](LICENSE), we cannot take any responsibility for damages arising from the use of this tool. This web application allows the processing, visualization and download of data from various authors. The licensing of this data and terms of use is always the responsibility of the authors of the data.


## Rationale
Natural hazards often consist of multiple, cascading processes (an earthquake causes a tsunami which damages powerlines, ...), whereas scientific models usually try to model just one of these processes at a time.
We exposed several scientific models as WPS and combined them in a simple web-frontend to allow for a more holistic approach to multistep risk-management.


## Background
This web application is a frontend for the orchestration of webservices. During the RIESGOS-project, a number of scientific models (resp. their results) have been exposed by the project-partners using the WPS ([web processing service](https://www.ogc.org/standards/wps)) protocol. This SOAP-protocol describes the in- and outputs to the model used. This website serves as a frontend to those models, aiming to:
 - allow the user to set the inputs to a model, trigger its execution and display the models results
 - chain a series of models together to form a scenario that depicts the mulititude of processes that describes a natural hazard (e.g. earthquake + tsunami + infrastructure, volcanic eruption + ashfall + lahar, ...)
 - make it easy for the user to explore the range of effects a natural hazard can have
