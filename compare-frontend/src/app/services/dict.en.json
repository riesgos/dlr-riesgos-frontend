The former, by definition, already includes earthquake damage while the latter only assumes the effects of the tsunami (as if it were far-field). For this calculation, a probabilistic model of compatibility between building typologies and damage states included in both classification schemes (earthquake and tsunami) is assumed.",

The arrival times refer to an approximation of the peak of the first wave. The maximum flow depth on land is provided in two resolutions, the whole coastal area is given at a resolution of 100m, whereas the inundation in the pilot areas is calculated with high resolution and displayed in a raster of 10m cell size.",
