A probabilistic model of compatibility between building typologies and damage states comprised in both classification schemes is assumed (Torres-Corredor et al., (2017) and Mavrouli et al., (2014)). Neither the time between them nor the recovery or restoration of the building between the occurrence of both events is taken into account.",

The fragility curves of the Mavrouli et al. model (2014) were initially developed for debris flows in non-volcanic environments. This model comprises 3 damage states, but they are named starting from D2 (D2, D3, D4), since it is assumed that slight damage would not occur after the occurrence of this type of event. Each damage state is associated with a fraction of the total economic replacement value of each building typology.",

The arrival times refer to an approximation of the peak of the first wave. The maximum flow depth on land is provided in two resolutions, the whole coastal area is given at a resolution of 100m, whereas the inundation in the pilot areas is calculated with high resolution and displayed in a raster of 10m cell size.",
